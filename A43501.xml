            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Author intreates thee to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for Truths; first, that all Books, Roles, Manuscripts in former times (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ came in the flesh) that did dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Christ the <hi>Messias</hi> that was to come in the flesh were in high esteem of all the Church. Secondly, That such Bookes that hold forth the Lord Jesus already come, in's Doctrine, Natures, Offices, Discipline, Benefits or Operations, are now to be esteemed of all Christians above great Volumes that do not:<note place="margin">☜</note> the fire of God hath so warm'd their enobled affections, that they are much taken in the reading of such Bookes though they come in a plain dresse. Thirdly, That all Prophets, Kings, Priests, Seers, Judges, and Patriarchs, were types of Christ to come, if we could search into this mystery. Fourthly, That all their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, sacrifices and prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fifthly, That the Sabbath was given to the Church to exercise their faith in the meditation on Christ that was to come,<note place="margin">☜</note> he being indeed
<pb facs="tcp:98028:3"/> the true Sabbath. Sixthly, That the Lords day and all the publique and private Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, are left to us Christians, that we might contemplate, and meditate on Christ, and so set before the view of our Faith, or understandings,<note place="margin">☞</note> all that Christ is, did or suffered for us, or hath brought unto us, and shall betide us in another world, and this is the chiefest worke, and greatest care of all Gospel Ministers, and they that hold not forth Christ crucified, in all their Preachings, Writings, and Printings, before the Peoples eyes, do nothing, or that, that's worse than nothing, trouble, weary, toil out themselves, and grieve others, whom God would have comforted and fed: I have heard sad complaints; what? not one bit of childrens bread in all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, though the Text was, <hi>Feed my Lambs.</hi> O, say they, we are utterly disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, we did hope to have been instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the faith of Gods power, but O, the lashings, invectives, and heavings at some of the most excellent Truths [by new termes of reproch] to render Truth dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and the entertainers of it od<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:98028:3"/> and what polite and elaborate Workes are extant to little profit to the truly enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christian, judge ye. Seventhly, the dayes of humiliation in former times, were soul-fatting, soul-satisfying, and soul-quieting dayes, dayes of atonement, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and union with God, in Christ to come,<note place="margin">☜</note> and that our Fasts are Evangelical in Christ who is already come, and if it were taught frequently, that Christ's Fasting, Conception, Birth, Life, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and Mediation, yea, all his thoughs, words, and workes were ours; he standing our surety, did it all for us; &amp; if this were believed really, no doubt, but we should finde more comfort in our hearts, courage in our fights, and have more soul ravishments, in the injoyment of our fully satisfied Father, than ever the Jewes had: but if we fast from false grounds, to wrong ends, no marvel if we are pensive, unsuccesfull and unhappy in all our undertakings. Eighthly, That the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace is one, and doth onely differ in some circumstantials,<note place="margin">☜</note>
               <hi>viz.</hi> in more clear dispensations and opener visions, and that
<pb facs="tcp:98028:4"/> we have farre more external priviledges than the Jewes ever had. Ninthly, That since Christs Ascension God doth satisfie the Church (in the satisfaction Christ hath once made) in all the meanes of Grace, God is fully satisfied and demands no more, Christ he dies no more, cries, fasts, lieth in the grave, nor prayeth no more, but now he rules all in Heaven and in Earth, to the worlds end. Tenthly, That the worke of Redemption, is fully and freely wrought by Christ, it is done already, not a doing, it was finish'd <hi>1634</hi> years ago and above, to the view of Angels and Men, and the discoverie and bringing this home to the consciences of men, is the worke of the eternal Spirit, by all the meanes in much mercie afforded us, as Ministerie, Word, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to reveal the everlasting Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel to the Church, so that Conversion, and the cleare manifestation of our salvation wrought by Christ, is all that Christians are to look after during life in this case. Eleventhly,<note place="margin">☞</note> That God in and by Prayer seekes, findes, and moves us; I say, he doth informe, inlarge, perswade, prevaile
<pb facs="tcp:98028:4"/> with, and changeth your mindes, helpes our infirmities, supplieth our defects, and doth comfort our hearts, refresh our drooping spirits, doth good to, and profiteth us: we do not adde any thing to God, neither are our prayers profitable to God, (to speak properly) but our prayers (or rather God by them) do abundantly prevail with others, and our selves are strengthened in the faith thereby, and indeed, we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered, undeceived, and discovered our selves to our selves, in, and by prayer God knoweth us throughly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, and <hi>James</hi> are to be understood. Twelfthly, That what ever is sound, ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and Truth in this little Book ensuing, he disclames, it's none of his own, but God's, and is resolved (his grace assisting him) to recant of whatsoever is unsound upon information, and conviction, and take it for a great mercie, in what he hath come short, to see any to enlarge themselves, and exalt Christ more.<note place="margin">☜</note> If there be any thing come to thy hand that's excellent, imbrace it, view the Texts well, and the inference from them; and if this take

Tis true, I grant you were once (in your own apprehensions,) under the tyranny of (that tyrant) the law, till it wearied, and almost woried you, it made your lives bitter, &amp; caused death to pass upon your consciences, so that you had no life, nor light, nor helpe, no hope of heaven or salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, but were possest with feares, and only had such sad conclusions as these. O! I shal perish, I am utterly lost. <hi>I</hi> am a dam'd cast away sinner, God hath forsaken me, there's no mercy for me, I am undone for ever. O! vile sinner that I am, a wretched Cative, and a hell-hound, what will become of me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day? where wilt thou goe O my poore soule? Into darkenesse, utter darkenesse, where's weeping and gnashing of teeth for ever, and pains that are easelesse, endlesse, and remedilesse. This was the working of Gods spirit of bondage on thee, though thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est it not, and a happie time when the Law did thus cruelly use thee, through that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and transcendent mercy of thy God, it did unexpectedly turne to thy good and unspeakable benefit: God seeing thee in this wofull plight, deploreable state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did commiserate thy case, and step't in to rescue thee, and by his sonne the true <hi>David,</hi> did freely and fully save thee at once from the law, sin, death, and the curse: so that as in the case of marriage, whiles the wife lives she is bound to her husband to obey in
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98028:84"/> all things, but death dissolveth this bond &amp; union. So here thou art dead to the law, but know then, by whose meanes, power, and godlinesse it is that thou art delivered out of so bad a condition, and put into so glorious, full, and happie estate.
